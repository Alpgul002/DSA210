**#Forecasting Daily Solar Panel Energy Production in İkitelli Using Weather Data**


In the modern energy sector, efficient operations and strategic decision-making are crucial. This project aims to develop a forecasting model that predicts daily solar panel energy production based on sunlight duration and associated weather conditions. The objective is to support energy trading decisions by providing accurate short-term predictions.

The developed forecasting model is expected to predict daily energy production with a high degree of accuracy. This prediction will be helpfull for applications in energy trading.

**Motivation:**

The primary goal is to optimize operational activities and enhance energy efficiency within the energy market. By accurately forecasting energy production, companies can better manage supply, reduce waste, and improve grid stability. 
Providing reliable forecasts allows stakeholders to make informed decisions in energy trading, ensuring that energy buying and selling are executed with maximum efficiency and minimum risk.

**Data Sources:**

The project uses publicly available data representing the daily energy production of a solar power plant located in Ikitelli, Istanbul for the year 2018. This dataset is provided by the 'Ulusal Akıllı Şehir Açık Veri Platformu'.

**Data Analysis Methods(Will be Considered):**

Cleaning and merging the two datasets (energy production and weather data). Analysis of the correlation between sunlight duration and energy production.

**Model Development(Will be Considered:)**

Selection of appropriate forecasting models and machine learning models.


**This project aims to predict relation between weather conditions and solar panel energy production. The success of this project will contribute to more efficient energy trading and improved operational planning for solar panel energy industry.**
